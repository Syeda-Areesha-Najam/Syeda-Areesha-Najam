- 🌿 I work full-time as a Software Engineer at [Spursol](https://www.spursol.com/), a company whose mission is to improve people's lives through simple, elegant, and innovative solutions.
  
- 🌟 While I've undertaken numerous research endeavors, here are a couple of captivating highlights from my undergrad journey:
  - **Nutrify** - Your Personal Diet Wizard 🍏 (Final Year Project)
      - 🧐 **What's it all about?** Nutrify isn't your ordinary diet app; it's a personalized food guru! We crafted 4600 authentic South Asian recipes, and then used that data to create a _**smart recommendation engine**_. Nutrify caters to your food preferences and health goals, making a balanced diet as easy as pie (or salad). 🥗
      - 🛠️ **Skills I Put to Use:** Python, Django, Deep Learning, Project Management, Machine Learning, Data Science
      - 🏆 **Achievements:**
        - Research abstract approved by SNEB [(Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/society-for-nutrition-education-and-behavior/) conference, reaffirming the impact of our research in the field of nutrition education.
        - Research poster, "Crafting a Healthier Desi Diet: Personalized And Balanced Recipe Recommendations through a Hybrid Recommendation System," won 2nd prize at the Dhanani School of Science & Engineering Undergraduate Research Symposium [(DURS2023)](https://habib.edu.pk/undergraduate-research-symposium/).

  - **Drowsiness Detection System** - A Lifesaver on the Road 🚗 (Deep Learning)
    - 😴 **Tackling a critical issue** - drowsy driving! We dove into the realm of artificial intelligence and deep learning to make roads safer. This project explored machine learning techniques to predict a driver's mental state, while looking at everything from facial expressions to bio-indicators. This research also included investigating data augmentation and the magic of transfer learning in **_Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)_**. 🧠
    - 🛠️ **Skills I Put to Use:** Python, Data Modeling, Data Analysis, Graphics Processing Unit, Deep Learning
    - 🏆 **Achievements:**
        - Research Paper accepted by IJSER [(International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Research)](https://www.ijser.in/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkNOpBhBEEiwAb3MvvW2CMT5WQOjhiYWhuaFGqX_JlXKftvrPbX_RrkJ4_y_wji8MLk6hAxoCfP8QAvD_BwE).
